# chirper

Chirper is a Twitter clone application designed to emulate the functionality and experience of the popular social media platform, Twitter. Similar to Twitter, Chirper allows users to create accounts, post short messages called "chirps" (equivalent to tweets), follow other users, and engage in conversations through likes, comments, and retweets.

Just like in Twitter, Chirper provides a timeline where users can view a chronological feed of chirps from the users they follow. It also includes features such as hashtags to categorize chirps and make them discoverable, user profiles with bio information and profile pictures, and notifications to keep users informed about new interactions on their chirps.

It is not finished yet but i have been able to redesign a few of the tweeter user interfaces and coplled with the [chirper-api](https://github.com/simondevz/chirper-api) I have been able to replicate quite a few of the functionality.

P.S This is a replica of the frontend folder in my [fake twitter app repo](https://github.com/simondevz/fake-twitter-app)
